My game is a shooting game where you jump through and hide in different maps while trying to shoot and kill other players. Shooting other players increases your score and highest score equals wins. Wins can improve your shield which will stop your health going down so quickly.
API code is included in server.js and user.js, although this works to some degree it could not be integrated with my game without effected functionality. I have included a video showing my API as well as my game video and still included my database code.
My game is a medieval theme with dungeon and castle maps.
For social interaction there is a chat box that also allows for private messages to be sent. 
Advanced features include the super and super super attack buttons.
